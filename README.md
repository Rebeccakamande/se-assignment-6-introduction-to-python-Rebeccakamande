2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.


   #Installing Python
   1.	Select Version to Install Python. Visit the official page for Python https://www.python.org/downloads/
   2.	Download the Python Installer.
   3.	Once you have downloaded the installer, open the .exe file, such as python-3.10.11-amd64.exe, by double-clicking it to launch the Python installer.
   5.	Running the Executable Installer
   6.	After completing the setup. Python will be installed on your Windows system. You will see a successful message.
   7. Verify the Python Installation in Windows.
   Verify Installation:

   Open Command Prompt.
   Type python --version or python -V and press Enter.
   You should see the version of Python that you installed.

   Set Up a Virtual Environment:
   Navigate to your project directory in Command Prompt.
   Run python -m venv myenv to create a virtual environment named myenv.
   Activate the virtual environment by running myenv\Scripts\activate.

   Verify Virtual Environment Activation:
   You should see (myenv) in the Command Prompt indicating the virtual environment is active.
   To deactivate, simply type deactivate.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   print("Hello, World!")
   The print() function is used to output text to the console.
   Strings in Python are enclosed in either single or double quotes.
   Indentation is used to denote blocks of code, although not necessary for single-line programs.
   Comments start with # and are used for documentation or explanation within the code.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Integer (int):
   Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal point.
   Example: x = 10

   Floating-point (float):
   Represents real numbers, including numbers with a decimal point or numbers in scientific notation.
   Example: y = 3.14

   String (str):
   Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed within single quotes (') or double quotes (").
   Example: name = "John"

   Boolean (bool):
   Represents a binary value of either True or False.
   Example: is_active = True

   List:
   Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types.
   Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   Tuple:
   Similar to lists but immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
   Example: coordinates = (10, 20)

   Dictionary (dict):
   Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.
   Example: person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

   x = 10
   y = 3.14
   name = "John"
   is_active = True
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   coordinates = (10, 20)
   person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

   print("Integer:", x)
   print("Floating-point:", y)
   print("String:", name)
   print("Boolean:", is_active)
   print("List:", numbers)
   print("Tuple:", coordinates)
   print("Dictionary:", person)


5. Control Structures:
   Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

   Conditional statements and loops are fundamental control structures in Python, allowing you to execute code conditionally based on certain conditions or to repeat code multiple times.

   Conditional Statements:
   Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

   Example of an if-else Statement:
   x = 10

   if x > 0:
      print("x is positive")
   else:
      print("x is not positive")

   Explanation:
   In this example, if the value of x is greater than 0, the statement print("x is positive") will be executed. Otherwise, the statement print("x is not positive") will be executed.

   Loops:
   Loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code multiple times.
   Example of a for Loop:
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   for num in numbers:
      print(num)

   Explanation:
   In this example, the for loop iterates over each element in the numbers list.
   For each iteration, the variable num takes on the value of the current element in the list, and the statement print(num) prints the value of num to the console.

   Example of a while Loop:
   count = 0

   while count < 5:
      print("Count:", count)
      count += 1

   Explanation:
   In this example, the while loop continues to execute as long as the condition count < 5 is true.
   Inside the loop, the statement print("Count:", count) prints the current value of count to the console, and count += 1 increments the value of count by 1 in each iteration.


6. Functions in Python:
   What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

   Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, modular components, making your code more organized, readable, and maintainable. Functions also promote code reusability and abstraction, as you can use the same function multiple times without having to rewrite the same code.
   
   result = add_numbers(3, 5)
   print("Sum:", result)


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Lists:
   Lists are ordered collections of items.
   Each item in a list is indexed by its position, starting from 0.
   Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents after creation.
   Lists allow duplicate values.
   Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   Dictionaries:
   Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
   Each item in a dictionary is accessed by its key.
   Dictionaries are mutable.
   Keys in a dictionary must be unique, but values can be duplicated.
   Example: person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

   Script Demonstrating Basic Operations:
   
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
   print("First number in the list:", numbers[0])
   print("Name of the person:", person['name'])
   numbers[0] = 10
   person['age'] = 25

   print("Modified list:", numbers)
   print("Modified dictionary:", person)

   numbers.append(6)
   person['gender'] = 'Female'

   print("List after adding an element:", numbers)
   print("Dictionary after adding a key-value pair:", person)

   numbers.remove(3)
   del person['city']

   print("List after removing an element:", numbers)
   print("Dictionary after removing a key-value pair:", person)

   print("Iterating over list:")
   for num in numbers:
      print(num)

   print("Iterating over dictionary:")
   for key, value in person.items():
      print(key, ":", value)

8. Exception Handling:
   What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully handle errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. It prevents the program from crashing and allows you to take appropriate action when an error occurs.

   Example of Exception Handling using try, except, and finally Blocks:

   try:
      x = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Cannot divide by zero!")
   except Exception as e:
      print("An error occurred:", e)
   finally:
      print("This block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred.")
   Try, except, and finally blocks are used for exception handling.
   The try block contains the code that may raise an exception.
   The except block catches and handles exceptions that occur within the try block.
   The finally block contains code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred, typically used for cleanup operations.


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.


   Modules:
   A module is a file containing Python code, which can include functions, classes, and variables.
   Modules allow you to organize and reuse code by breaking it into manageable, reusable components.
   You can create your own modules or use built-in and third-party modules.

   Packages:
   A package is a collection of modules organized in a directory hierarchy.
   Packages use a special __init__.py file to indicate that the directory is a package. This file can be empty or execute initialization code for the package.
   Packages allow you to organize modules into namespaces, making it easier to manage large codebases.

   import math
   result = math.sqrt(16)
   print("Square root of 16 is:", result)
   pi_value = math.pi
   print("Value of pi is:", pi_value)


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

   Python provides built-in functions to read from and write to files. The open function is used to open a file, and it can be used in various modes like reading ('r'), writing ('w'), and appending ('a'). After performing file operations, it's important to close the file using the close method or by using a context manager (with statement), which handles closing the file automatically.

   Reading from a File
   Here's a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console:

   def read_file(file_path):
      try:
         with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
               content = file.read()
               print(content)
      except FileNotFoundError:
         print(f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")

   file_path = 'example.txt'
   read_file(file_path)
   
   Writing to a File
   Here's a script that writes a list of strings to a file:

   def write_to_file(file_path, lines):
      with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
         for line in lines:
               file.write(line + '\n')

   file_path = 'output.txt'
   lines = ['Hello, World!', 'Python is great!', 'File handling in Python.']
   write_to_file(file_path, lines)
